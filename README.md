## **Advanced Data Analysis Project**

## **📌 Overview**
This project examines **suspicious web threat interactions** using **advanced data analysis** techniques. Through **machine learning, anomaly detection, and network analysis**, we aim to enhance cybersecurity monitoring and threat mitigation.

## **🚀 Objectives**
- Detect anomalies in web traffic
- Classify threats using machine learning models
- Analyze network behaviors to uncover attack patterns
- Generate cybersecurity recommendations

## **📊 Dataset Information**
The dataset `CloudWatch_Traffic_Web_Attack.csv` contains network traffic logs, including timestamps, IP-related details, and various network metrics. These features help assess security risks and identify suspicious activities.

## **🔧 Dependencies & Setup**
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn networkx
```
Use Python 3.8+ for optimal compatibility.

## **⚙️ Data Preprocessing**
Data cleaning and enhancement involve:
- Converting timestamps for precise analysis
- Filling missing values to maintain data integrity
- Engineering features like session duration and traffic ratios
- Label encoding categorical variables for machine learning models
- Normalizing numerical features for improved performance

## **📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key visualizations include:
- **Traffic Byte Distribution:** Understanding data flow volume
- **Protocol Usage Analysis:** Identifying dominant communication protocols
- **Traffic Trends Over Time:** Detecting peak activity hours
- **Top 10 Traffic Source Countries:** Highlighting regions with high request counts

## **🚨 Anomaly Detection**
We use **Isolation Forest** to detect unusual activities in network traffic. This helps pinpoint potential cyber threats, often characterized by extreme byte interaction ratios.

## **🧠 Machine Learning Classification**
We apply **Random Forest and Neural Networks** to classify detected threats.  
### **🔹 Random Forest**
- Provides feature importance insights
- Balances model efficiency and interpretability  
### **🔹 Neural Network**
- Handles complex interactions  
- Adapts well to evolving threat landscapes  

## **🔗 Network Analysis**
Graph-based analysis allows us to visualize **IP connections and data flows**.  
- Nodes represent IPs  
- Edges indicate active connections  
- Helps detect irregular network structures  

## **🔍 Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**
Using **PCA and KMeans clustering**, we segment traffic behavior into meaningful groups. This aids in identifying suspicious clusters for security monitoring.

## **✅ Key Findings & Recommendations**
### **🔹 Findings**
- Suspicious activity peaks during specific business hours
- Anomalous traffic originates predominantly from five key countries
- Unusual byte interactions signal potential security risks  

### **🔹 Recommendations**
✔ Deploy real-time monitoring for high-risk traffic  
✔ Strengthen firewall rules in identified regions  
✔ Investigate off-hour data anomalies  
✔ Use ML-based ensemble models for better detection accuracy
